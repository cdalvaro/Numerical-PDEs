# Numerical PDEs

This program contains some examples for solving wave functions numerically.

It also contains other methods to solve Laplace's and Poisson's equations, it can compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors for matrices, also it can solve systems of equations.

This project uses a custom matrix class to perform all the operations as well as an OpenGL class to plot the results in real time.

I will update this file soon with more information about the project, giving some explanations about the methods used on it...
